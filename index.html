            <p>Hello everyone, I'm Zhiming Chen, also known as Zhai Mi, a comic creator and researcher in the field of comics. I have a deep passion for comics and strive to integrate theory with practical creation.</p>
            <p>In the past, I was invited to sign with Beijing Dongman Entertainment Co., Ltd. (the Chinese branch of Korea's WEBTOON), where I completed the webcomic "Falling in Love with the Big Sly". I also earned a doctoral degree in Drama and Film Studies from Fujian Normal University and currently hold the position of Associate Professor at Fuzhou University of International Studies and Trade. Through valuable work experience and academic background, I have accumulated rich experience and knowledge.</p>
            <p>I enjoy approaching comics from interdisciplinary and cross-media perspectives, and I am enthusiastic about integrating these ideas into my creative work. On my personal website, you can find my latest projects and portfolio showcasing my skills and creativity.</p>
            <p>I believe in the transformative power of comics to make the world a better place and hope to contribute to the flourishing of comics through my work. If you are interested in my work or would like to know more, please feel free to contact me.</p>
            <p>Thank you!</p>
